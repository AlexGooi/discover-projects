# JADS Discover Machine Learning projects

## A selection of 'discovery projects' for getting hands-on experience in machine learning
This repository was developed as part of the Discover track at the [Jheronimus Academy of Data Science (JADS)](https://www.jads.nl/professionaleducation.html). The aim of these 'discovery projects' is to facilitate the participants in getting hands-on experience in building a model following the CRISP-DM framework. Learning-by-doing is arguably the best way to get through the [valley of despair](https://mensenengedrag.nl/2019/06/05/the-dunning-kruger-effect-in-innovation/) as quickly as possible.

## A curated selection of public datasets, notebooks, articles and other stuff from the commons
[Made with the creative commons in mind](https://creativecommons.org/use-remix/made-with-cc/), we have used and remixed what we think are the most useful datasets, notebooks, articles available in the public domain. Each folder contains a set of materials for a given dataset, with specific assignments and questions. Examples of solutions and best practices are included in R and Python notebooks. In due course we aim to add [H2O Flow](https://docs.h2o.ai/h2o/latest-stable/h2o-docs/flow.html) for those preferring to work using a graphical UI.

  - [Ames Housing dataset by Dean de Kock (2011)](http://jse.amstat.org/v19n3/decock.pdf): an alternative, more detailed and rich dataset than the Boston housing dataset (which dates from 1978). Available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/prevek18/ames-housing-dataset) and via the [AmesHousing R package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/AmesHousing/AmesHousing.pdf).
  - [UCI Heart Disease dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/heart+disease): four combined databases compiling heart disease information. This database contains 76 attributes, but all published experiments refer to using a subset of 14 of them. In particular, the Cleveland database is the only one that has been used by ML researchers to this date. The "goal" field refers to the presence of heart disease in the patient. It is integer valued from 0 (no presence) to 4. Also available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/ronitf/heart-disease-uci), [data.world](https://data.world/uci/heart-disease) and included in the [kmed R package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/kmed/index.html)
  - [Pima Indians Diabetes database](): this dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. The objective of the dataset is to diagnostically predict whether or not a patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset. Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database. In particular, all patients here are females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage. Interestingly, the objective of the [original study by Schulz et al. in 2006](https://care.diabetesjournals.org/content/29/8/1866) was to determine genetic and environmental determinants for type 2 diabetes and obesity. To this purpose, the effects of different environments on these diseases in Pima Indians in Mexico and Available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database), [data.world](https://data.world/data-society/pima-indians-diabetes-database) and included in the [mlbench R package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/mlbench/index.html). Note there is a different [UCI diabetes dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/diabetes)
  - [Credit Card Fraud dataset](https://mlg.ulb.ac.be/wordpress/portfolio_page/defeatfraud-assessment-and-validation-of-deep-feature-engineering-and-learning-solutions-for-fraud-detection/): the datasets contains transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by european cardholders and was compiled by the Machine Learning group of Université Libre de Bruxelles in collaboration with Worldline. This dataset presents transactions that occurred in two days, where we have 492 frauds out of 284,807 transactions. The dataset is highly unbalanced, the positive class (frauds) account for 0.172% of all transactions.<br>. It contains only numerical input variables which are the result of a PCA transformation, as due to confidentiality issues the original features cannot be provided. Features V1, V2, … V28 are the principal components obtained with PCA, the only features which have not been transformed with PCA are 'Time' and 'Amount'. Feature 'Time' contains the seconds elapsed between each transaction and the first transaction in the dataset. The feature 'Amount' is the transaction Amount, this feature can be used for example-dependant cost-senstive learning. Feature 'Class' is the response variable and it takes value 1 in case of fraud and 0 otherwise.
