# Pima Indians Diabetes dataset

Predict the onset of diabetes based on diagnostic measures.

## Data description
This dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. The objective is to predict based on diagnostic measurements whether a patient has diabetes.

Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database. In particular, all patients here are females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage.

Pregnancies: Number of times pregnant
Glucose: Plasma glucose concentration a 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test
BloodPressure: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)
SkinThickness: Triceps skin fold thickness (mm)
Insulin: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)
BMI: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)
DiabetesPedigreeFunction: Diabetes pedigree function
Age: Age (years)
Outcome: Class variable (0 or 1)

## Tasks
  - Construct at least 2 different types of prediction models
  - Interpret the different models and argue which one is more easily explainable. Use any of the following libraries for interpreting models: [SHAP](https://shap.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), [lime](https://github.com/marcotcr/lime), [sklearn partial dependence plot](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/partial_dependence.html), [ELI5](https://eli5.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
